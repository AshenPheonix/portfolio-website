									<h3 class="major">Piano Board</h3>
									<p>
										The Piano Board Project, viewable in my github, was a project done to allow a Raspberry Pi B to play a "piano board" created by the other members of the Computer Science Club I was in at the time.
										Sounds were provided by another member, hence the reason they are missing from the repo, so you will need to provide your own if you want to use this project.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Projects Not On Display</h3>
									<p>
										I have had a few failed projects that go here and accumulate to about 2 years of work. I will say I was never fired or quit a job, my job life has been just that weird.
										Included here is a QT project that linked 2 SQL databases to a created SQLite3 database made on a new server to allow for students in a certain path (nursing) to get
										to some internships that were required as part of the curriculum. The databases were latere not allowed because the group with the permissions refused to let us access
										them, and this caused a cascade that litigated this project out of existance. I am still proud of it though.
									</p>
									<p>
										Also included here are a pair of projects done for local businesses, one of which got cancelled because the owner stopped contacting anyone and everyone else involved
										in the project, including those who set it up in the first place, and the second job canceled because the owner, well, died suddenly. These involved linking databases
										from other companies (Quicken), calculating out volumes and surface areas given measurments, and calclating costs of subcontractors and materials for on the jobsite 
										use. Also made recipts in HTML format for printing.
